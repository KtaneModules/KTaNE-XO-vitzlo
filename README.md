# XO

My second modded module for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, XO. XO is a cipher-based module
where unfinished tic-tac-toe boards are shown, and the games must be played out in order to 
decrypt a six-letter word.

Concept based on a puzzle from the 2020 Husky Hunt. Sound effects based on XO Tour Llif3 by Lil Uzi Vert.

Special thanks to Danny7007 for once again helping with this module's creation.
